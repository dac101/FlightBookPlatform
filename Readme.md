# Flight Book Platform — Trip Builder

A fully functional Laravel flight booking web application and API for building and navigating trips for a single passenger.

---

## Project Overview

This application allows users to search and book flights across airports, build multi-segment trips, and manage their bookings through a modern single-page application interface.

### Supported Trip Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| **One-Way** | A flight getting from A to B |
| **Round-Trip** | A pair of one-ways: A → B then B → A |
| **Open-Jaw** | A pair of one-ways: A → B then C → A |
| **Multi-City** | Up to 5 one-ways: A → B → C → D → E |

### Business Rules

- A trip **must** depart no earlier than the time of creation
- A trip **must** depart no later than 365 days after creation
- Trip price = sum of all referenced flight prices
- Flights are priced per single passenger in a neutral currency

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | PHP 8.4, Laravel 13 |
| Frontend | Vue 3, Inertia.js v3, Vite |
| Auth | Laravel Breeze + Fortify |
| Queue | Laravel Horizon (Redis) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 |
| Cache/Sessions | Redis 7 |
| Web Server | Nginx |
| Mail (dev) | Mailpit |
| Containerisation | Docker Compose |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Mac / Windows / Linux)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/zentrianalytics/flightbookplatform.git
cd flightbookplatform
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your AviationStack API key (free at [aviationstack.com](https://aviationstack.com)):

```
AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### 3. Build and start containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

> First build takes a few minutes. Subsequent starts are fast.

The entrypoint script automatically:
- Installs Composer dependencies
- Installs npm dependencies and builds frontend assets
- Waits for PostgreSQL to be ready
- Runs database migrations
- Seeds demo users, airlines, airports, and sample flights on first boot
- Reprocesses bundled AviationStack JSON files on first boot

### 4. Open the application

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Application | http://localhost |
| Mailpit (test mail) | http://localhost:8025 |
| Horizon dashboard | http://localhost/horizon |

If you want live AviationStack imports to work, set a valid `AVIATIONSTACK_API_KEY` in `.env` before starting the containers.

## Source Code Architecture

The backend follows a repository pattern so business logic is separated from persistence logic. Controllers delegate to service classes such as [FlightService.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Services/FlightService.php), [TripService.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Services/TripService.php), and [FlightImportService.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Services/FlightImportService.php), while data access is handled through repository interfaces and implementations under [app/Repositories](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Repositories) and [app/Repositories/Contracts](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Repositories/Contracts). This structure makes the code easier to test, maintain, and extend as the application grows beyond demo data.

Flight import and reprocessing workflows are handled asynchronously with Laravel Horizon and Redis-backed queues. Live AviationStack payloads are fetched by [FetchFlightDataCommand.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Console/Commands/FetchFlightDataCommand.php), stored to JSON by [AviationStackService.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Services/AviationStackService.php), and processed in the background by [ProcessAviationStackFlightsJob.php](/Users/dacoriesmith/Developer/BitBucket/flightbookplatform/app/Jobs/ProcessAviationStackFlightsJob.php), allowing larger import workloads to be handled without blocking user-facing requests.

## Artisan Commands

```bash
# Fetch live flight data from AviationStack (runs automatically every 12 hours)
docker compose exec php php artisan flights:fetch

# Run database migrations
docker compose exec php php artisan migrate

# Seed sample data
docker compose exec php php artisan db:seed

# Monitor queues
docker compose exec php php artisan horizon
```

---

## Scheduled Jobs

| Schedule | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Every 12 hours (06:00 & 18:00) | `flights:fetch` | Fetches live arrivals for 8 airports from AviationStack API, saves raw JSON to storage, and dispatches processing jobs to the `flight-imports` Horizon queue |

---

## Sample Data

The database seeder includes the following sample data from the assignment specification:

**Airlines:** Air Canada (AC), WestJet (WJ), Porter Airlines (PD)

**Airports:** YUL (Montreal), YVR (Vancouver), YYZ (Toronto), YYC (Calgary)

**Flights:**

| Flight | Route | Departure | Arrival | Price |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC301 | YUL → YVR | 07:35 | 10:05 | $273.23 |
| AC302 | YVR → YUL | 11:30 | 19:11 | $220.63 |
| AC101 | YUL → YYZ | 06:00 | 07:30 | $149.00 |
| AC201 | YYZ → YVR | 09:00 | 11:45 | $310.00 |
| WJ500 | YYC → YYZ | 08:15 | 12:30 | $195.00 |
